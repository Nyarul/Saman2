üöå Transport Management System üöó

üìö Overview
The Transport Management System (TMS) is a comprehensive solution designed to manage traffic violations, vehicle details, and user data. It tracks summonses issued, payment statuses, and violation details through a robust database system, ensuring efficient monitoring and management.

üóÉÔ∏è Database Overview
Database: umt_transport_db

üèóÔ∏è Project Structure
The project is structured to facilitate development and management:

build/: Contains build-related files and compiled artifacts.

nbproject/: Project files for NetBeans IDE.

src/: Source code files for the system.

test/: Test files for the system's functionalities.

web/: Frontend files for the web-based user interface.

build.xml: Build configuration file.

üîß Installation
To set up the system on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository (if applicable).

Install dependencies for the web application and backend (specific instructions can be added here depending on the tech stack used).

Set up the database by importing the SQL dump (umt_transport_db.sql) into your MariaDB or MySQL instance.

bash
Copy
Edit
mysql -u username -p < /path/to/umt_transport_db.sql
Configure your application settings, such as database credentials in configuration files.

Run the application by using the appropriate command for your environment (e.g., npm start, php artisan serve).

üéÆ Usage
Once the system is running, you can:

View and manage traffic summonses: Add, update, and view summonses for vehicles.

Track payments: Update the status of a summons when a fine is paid.

Appeal process: Change the status of a summons if a violation is contested.
